## <font color=#6495ED>Overview of Project</font>
UFO is a topic that we have been interested in since we were children. For this assignment the only thing we have to go on is a JavaScript file filled to the brim with sighting information. Countries, cities, states, type of sighting, there is a lot in this file. We are aware of JavaScript’s visual functionality. Our plan is first to use JavaScript to display data as a table. However, there is so much data, sifting through it without adjustment would be challenge. JavaScript provides a way to manipulate the data by adding filters. It’s trickier to add more than one filters. We want to put everything together in a tidy HTML page, the article, the table of data to support findings, and easy to use filters to fine turn the results. 


### <font color=#6495D>Purposes</font>

1. Create a webpage (HTML) that will allow users to view the data and input filters for multiple criteria at the same time.
2. Use a popular JavaScript library, D3.js, to equip the website to "listen" for events for users' input.
3. Create a filterable and dynamic table to display the data.
4. Customize the webpage by adding specific CSS components to the stylesheet.

- From the console of browser's DevTool, we can see the filters as an object with key-value pair entries.

## <font color=#6495ED>Summary</font>
* The style of the table is too basic, it needs more professional polish.
* We recommend that we can add a link on each Comment to google search engine so that viewers can get further information.
* We also recommend that we can put a google map as a component of the webpage to enhance visualization, adding marks based on results of the filtering.
